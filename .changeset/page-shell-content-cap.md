### `ds-page-shell` caps and centres its content column on wide viewports

The shell now keeps a single centred column for header inner content, the aside + main row, and footer inner content. On viewports above the cap (default `90rem` / 1440 px), brand, sidenav, and main all line up vertically; below the cap, layout is unchanged.

- **New CSS custom property: `--ds-page-shell-max-width`.** Defaults to `90rem`. Consumers override per-app, e.g. `ds-page-shell { --ds-page-shell-max-width: 96rem; }` for a wider dashboard or `64rem` for a marketing-narrow look.
- **Header and footer chrome stay full-bleed.** The sticky header's border + backdrop blur and the footer's border still extend to the viewport edges — only the content inside each is centred. That preserves the "application chrome" feel without sprawl.
- **Aside + main share the cap.** When a sidenav is present, sidenav width + main width together equal the cap (sidenav at its natural width, main flexes to fill the rest). When the aside slot is empty, main alone fills the centred column.
- **Mobile drawer behaviour is unchanged.** Below 768 px the aside still becomes an absolute drawer over main with backdrop and Escape-to-close.

### Internal restructure

The shadow DOM gained two intermediate wrappers: `.shell-inner` inside `<header>` and `<footer>`, and a `.shell-body` (exposed as `part="body"`) wrapping aside + main. Direct selectors like `aside`, `main`, `.menu-toggle`, `.mobile-backdrop` are unchanged, so most consumer styles continue to work. If you were targeting the host's grid template directly with custom CSS, expect to update — the host now uses flex column with grid only inside `.shell-body`.
