Two layout improvements to `ds-page-shell` raised from a consumer integration:

- **The desktop aside now sits flush with its column edge.** The aside previously used `scrollbar-gutter: stable`, permanently reserving ~14 px on the inline-end side for a potential scrollbar. Stacked with `<main>`'s padding, that produced a noticeably asymmetric horizontal gap between aside content and main content that consumers couldn't account for in their own layout. The base aside selector drops the reservation so `<main>` solely owns the gap; the scrollbar appears on demand when the aside genuinely overflows. The mobile drawer keeps `scrollbar-gutter: auto` as before.
- **New `aside-end` slot.** Mirrors the existing `aside` (inline-start) for inline-end side regions — table-of-contents columns, contextual help panels, etc. Driven by a new `end-label` attribute (defaults to `Secondary navigation`) applied as `aria-label` on the secondary `<aside>`. The grid template adapts to which sides are populated (`auto 1fr auto` / `1fr auto` / `auto 1fr` / `1fr`). Mobile layout hides the inline-end region in v1; consumers can re-surface it via `::part(aside-end)`. The primary aside now also receives `aria-label` from `menu-label` for a11y parity.
